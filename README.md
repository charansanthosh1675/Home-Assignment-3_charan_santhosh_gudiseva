##  Tasks Completed

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: RNN Text Generation
- Implemented an LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network.
- Trained on a short text sample to predict the next character.
- Demonstrated temperature-based sampling to control randomness of text output.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: NLP Preprocessing
- Tokenized text using a custom regex-based method.
- Removed English stopwords using NLTK.
- Applied stemming with PorterStemmer.
- Explained:
  - Difference between stemming and lemmatization
  - When removing stopwords is helpful or harmful

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Used SpaCy (`en_core_web_sm`) to extract named entities.
- Printed entity labels, names, and character offsets.
- Explained difference between NER and POS tagging, with real-world applications.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Scaled Dot-Product Attention
- Implemented attention using NumPy:
  - Dot product of Query and Key
  - Scaled by âˆšd
  - Applied softmax to get attention weights
  - Multiplied by Value matrix
- Explained why scaling is important and how attention helps in NLP models.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Sentiment Analysis using Transformers
- Used HuggingFace `pipeline("sentiment-analysis")` to classify text.
- Output sentiment label and confidence score.
- Explained BERT vs GPT, and benefits of using pretrained models.
